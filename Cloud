                <p>
                    In a nutshell, Cloud Computing provides range of services over the internet
                    or "THE CLOUD". Cloud usually ehnances the use of remote servers instead of 
                    the local hard drives and private data centres.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Before Cloud Computing came into existence, Organizations has to purchase own 
                    servers to meet bussiness needs.To reduce the risk of downtime and outages, 
                    and to accomodate peak traffic volume, larger number of server spaces were 
                    required but today's cloud server reduced the need for onsite servers, as well
                    establishes maintenance personnel, and other costly IT resources.

                <p>
                    Cloud Computing has 3 types of deployment models
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Private Cloud</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    In this model, Single business entity holds the proprietary where the physical
                    components stored on the premises. This model holds an high degree of control,
                    because this is only accessible to a single business model. Advanced security 
                    protocols and the computing resources extended to virtualized environment makes 
                    it advantageous. An organization can contract with third party cloud vendors 
                    onsite to host and makes exclusive servers available to the internal users via 
                    the intranet, offsite.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Public Cloud</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    This model uses the internet to store and access data and applications. It 
                    provides an virtualized environment to the users ensuring the shared resources 
                    are leveraged. The resources delivered over the web are scales more easily by 
                    the organizations. The services provided ensures robust security measures to 
                    protect data and avoids it from third party accessibilities.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Hybrid Cloud</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    This model combines both private and public cloud models that allows organizations
                    to ensure shared resources while using existing IT resources and critical security
                    requirements. Allows companies to store confidential data internally and access it 
                    via applications running with public cloud models. An organization choses to store 
                    sensitive user data in private cloud and resource intensive computation in public 
                    cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, organizations can chose to work with <b>multi-cloud</b>, which uses 
                    more than one public cloud service. This model makes the flow workloads across
                    multiple platforms, and ensures performance desirability, flexibility, and cost 
                    savings.

            <p><b><h3>Cloud Computing Examples</h3></b></p>
            <p><ul><li><b>Software as a Service(SaaS)</b></li></ul></p>
            <p><h4>
                Traditionally, Software was installed directly on each device. Web Applications are hosted in 
                the cloud to reduce costs through pay-as-you-go pricing(users pay as per thry consume).
                End users easily conect through a web browser or mobile device and IT departments are not
                involved in management or maintenance.
                EXAMPLE- Gmail,Salesforce, and Cloud Storage Devices like OneDrive

                <p><ul><li>Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)</li></ul></p>
                This model moves an organization's entire datacentre to cloud. The business rents virtual machine's,
                virtual servers, operating systems and other IT infrastructure on pay-as-you-go basis
                EXAMPLE- microsoft azure, google cloud.

                <p><ul><li>Platform as a Service(PaaS)</li></ul></p>
                This model provides a power to develop software without maintaining the backend environment.
                Vendors customises and optimizes the environment based on business needs and makes use of supplemental 
                developmental tools such as storage resources, services and controls.
